# Kubernetes Application Project

## Overview
This project involves setting up and managing a Kubernetes cluster using Minikube. Docker containers for Django and React applications are deployed into Kubernetes pods, with a focus on achieving deployment replication, auto-healing, and auto-scaling.

## Key Components
1. **Kubernetes Cluster Setup**
   - Built using Minikube.

2. **Docker Container Management**
   - Managed Docker containers for Django and React applications.
   - Deployed containers into Kubernetes pods.

3. **Kubernetes Management**
   - Managed deployment replication.
   - Implemented auto-healing and auto-scaling for the Kubernetes cluster.
   - Managed network and services with host IP allocation.

## Setup Guide
1. **Install Prerequisites**
   - Minikube
   - Docker
   - kubectl
     
2. **Start Minikube**
   ```bash
    minikube start
    ```

3. **Build and Deploy Docker Containers**
   - Build Docker images for your Django and React applications.
   - Create Kubernetes pods and services using ` kubectl apply -f <file-name>.yaml `

4. **Scale and Manage Deployments**
    - Use `kubectl` commands to scale deployments and manage pods.

## Usage
1. **Start Minikube**
   ```bash
   minikube start
   ```
   
2. **Deploy Applications**
   - Apply the pod, deployment, and service configurations using kubectl.

3. **Scale Deployment**
   ```bash
   kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=<number-of-replicas>
   ```

5. **Monitor Pods**
   ```bash
    kubectl get pods
   ```

## Achievements
- Successfully reduced downtime in the production environment.
