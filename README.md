## Introduction
Fish Recognition is a deep learning project designed to identify various species of fish from images. This can be useful for fisheries management, conservation efforts, and automating monitoring processes.

## Dataset
The project uses the [Nature Conservancy Fisheries Monitoring dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-nature-conservancy-fisheries-monitoring) from Kaggle. This dataset contains thousands of labeled images of different fish species, which are used to train and evaluate the model.

## Model
The project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in Python using popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras. The model architecture and training process are detailed in the `cnn.ipynb` and `FishRecognition.ipynb` notebooks.

## Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bshan11/Fish-Recognition.git
    cd Fish-Recognition
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the appropriate directory.

4. Run the Jupyter notebooks to train and evaluate the model:
    - `FishRecognition.ipynb`
    - `cnn.ipynb`

## Results
The results of the model, including accuracy and loss metrics, are documented in the Jupyter notebooks. Example predictions and visualizations are also provided.
